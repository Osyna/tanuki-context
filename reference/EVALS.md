# Evals

tanuki publishes the **harness, not a percentage.** A savings number nobody
can re-measure is the exact failure this project exists to avoid (the rakuen
post *"Token compression tools measure the wrong thing"* — this repo's own
bar). Every harness is seeded and reproducible.

Below is a real API run on **2026-07-28** across five models — `claude-opus-5`,
`claude-opus-4-8`, `claude-sonnet-5`, `claude-sonnet-4-5`, `claude-haiku-4-5`.
Where a number does not flatter the tool, it is here anyway.

## TL;DR — what's proven, what's open

- **Proven, deterministic:** imaging cuts input tokens **72–94%** on real logs;
  `estimate` prices it and the router picks the right route (§1, §5).
- **Proven, measured:** dense random strings never survive pixels —
  **0/14 byte-exact, every one of 5 models** — which is *why* the `verbatim`
  sidecar carries them as text and the credential gate refuses to image secrets
  (§2).
- **Model-dependent:** image *comprehension* needs a capable reader —
  opus-4-8 / opus-5 / sonnet-5 solve the task off pixels as well as off text;
  sonnet-4-5 and haiku-4-5 do not (§3). The fidelity band is calibrated to a
  capable reader — measure yours.
- **Open, not a win yet:** handing the tools to a fully-autonomous agent loop
  thrashes on our harness. Drive tanuki *explicitly* (estimate → render); don't
  dump the tools on the agent and hope (§6).

## 1. Pricing — `estimate --model`   *(deterministic, no vision needed)*

`estimate` prices the decision in real dollars via each provider's tile/patch
rule. Two corpora, two providers:

| corpus | raw text tokens | imaged | cut | $ text → image |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 384 KB / 4,001-line log (opus-4) | 95,980 | 20,160 | **−79%** | $1.44 → $0.30 |
| 384 KB, distill+codebook+tiny (opus-4) | 95,980 | 112 | **−100%** | $1.44 → $0.0017 |
| 1,200-line service log (sonnet-5) | 18,525 | 3,920 | **−79%** | $0.0556 → $0.0118 |

```
node dist/cli.js estimate <log> 0 --model claude-opus-4 [--distill --codebook --font tiny]
```

## 2. Read-back fidelity — `npm run needles`   *(measured)*

Blind byte-exact transcription of 14 dense random needles per density (uuid,
semver, hex id, `sha256:`, `path:line:col`, base64, ms timestamp),
containment-scored:

| model | normal (5×8) | tiny (4×6) |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| claude-opus-5 | 0/14 | 0/14 |
| claude-opus-4-8 | 0/14 | 0/14 |
| claude-sonnet-5 | 0/14 | 0/14 |
| claude-sonnet-4-5 | 0/14 | 0/14 |
| claude-haiku-4-5 | 0/14 | 0/14 |

**0/14 across every model.** The misses are **value-drift** — confident
single-character misreads (`3→1`, `4→a`, `5→8`, `a→3`), delivered as fact, not
blanks. That is the silent failure the project is built around, and **why the
`verbatim` sidecar exists**: it ships 10/14 of these needles as text beside the
pages, so exactness never rides on transcription. (An earlier run scored
opus-5 at 1/14 — read-back of random strings is near-chance, so treat the floor
as 0–1/14, not zero-with-certainty.) `claude-fable-5` refuses the task outright
(`stop_reason: refusal`).

Takeaway: dense random strings — hashes, ids, secrets — must never be trusted
to pixels. The credential gate enforces that for secrets; `tanuki_verify` is
the deterministic backstop for anything you *do* read off a page (`exact` /
`corrected` / `ambiguous` / `absent`, no model), so a silent miss becomes a
flagged one.

`score` also splits *glyph-shape* confusions (a bigger font could recover)
from *value-drift* (it cannot). base64 and ms are deliberately **not** matched
by the production `scanNeedles` sidecar — a generic base64 pattern would
false-positive across normal logs — so they ride font fidelity alone.

## 3. Task comprehension — `npm run taskqual`   *(measured)*

The claim that matters: can the model still **do the job** from image pages?
Find the FATAL root-cause component in a 120-line log, TEXT arm vs IMAGE-pages
arm, same model, **n=5 seeds**:

| model | text | image | image reads pages? |
| --- | ---: | ---: | :---: |
| claude-opus-4-8 | 5/5 | 5/5 | ✅ |
| claude-opus-5 | 4/5 | 5/5 | ✅ |
| claude-sonnet-5 | 5/5 | 5/5 | ✅ |
| claude-sonnet-4-5 | 5/5 | **0/5** | ❌ |
| claude-haiku-4-5 | 3/5 | **0/5** | ❌ |

**Image comprehension tracks model capability.** The three capable readers
match their text score off the pixels — the whole thesis, measured: *prose and
structure survive imaging.* But sonnet-4-5 and haiku-4-5, strong on the text
arm, drop to **0/5** on image — they cannot reliably read one line out of a
dense page. They misread the panic line as a nearby word (`worker`,
`LatenciesMs`), not blanks.

This is the honest caveat behind the `fidelity` band: the DeepSeek-OCR curve it
maps to assumes a *capable* OCR reader. A smaller model underperforms the band,
so the band is an upper bound, not a promise — run this harness on the model
you actually use before trusting imaged pages for comprehension. The knob that
recovers a weak reader is **a larger font / lower density**, not a lossier
tier.

## 4. Lossy tiers: tokens vs task — `npm run tier`   *(measured)*

Levels 2–4, `--distill`, `--codebook`, `--font tiny` are **not** byte-lossless.
Do they keep the *task* solvable? Same root-cause task per tier, on a capable
reader (`claude-sonnet-5`, **n=5 seeds**):

| tier | image-tokens | vs raw text | task solved |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| L0 normal (near-lossless) | 2,240 | −76% | **5/5** |
| L4 caveman (normal font) | 2,240 | −76% | **5/5** |
| distill (errors kept verbatim) | 728 | −92% | 1/5 |
| L0 tiny (4×6) | 1,400 | −85% | 0/5 |
| distill tiny | 560 | −94% | 1/5 |
| distill+codebook tiny | 560 | −94% | 1/5 |
| L4 caveman tiny | 1,400 | −85% | 0/5 |

The fidelity-preserving cut is **normal font**: L0 and even L4 caveman (which
telegraphs prose but keeps the FATAL line verbatim and legible) hold at 5/5
while cutting **76%**. Two knobs break the task on this reader: **tiny font**
(4×6 is past the legibility cliff — 0/5) and **distill** (reshaping the log into
a denser page drops it to 1/5, even though the FATAL line survives verbatim —
the model reads the smaller, restructured page worse). A stronger reader
(opus-class) tolerates distill better; a weaker one, worse. **The sell:** reach
for L0 or caveman at normal font for a −76% cut with the task intact; reserve
tiny font and heavy distill for bulk you only need the gist of.

## 5. The router — `estimate.route` / `recommend`   *(deterministic)*

Since 0.12.0 `estimate` returns a **`route`**: one hybrid pick (image / text /
raw) that weighs real cost **and** the read-back fidelity band **and** the
content — not just token count. It images only when imaging clears the clean
band *and* is the genuine save; it routes to the lossless text side on
credentials, cached content, or past-the-cliff density. On the 1,200-line log:

```
route: { pick: "image", fidelity: "high", savedPct: 81,
         reason: "imaging clears the read-back band and beats the text side on tokens" }
```

The same call also prices a **no-image** route (`recommend.text`): lossless
whitespace plus a distill sibling, so there is a token answer even when imaging
is the wrong call. On that log, `recommend.text.withDistill` is **100 tokens**
(distill-as-text) vs 18,525 raw — the router's answer when you must keep the
bytes as text. Every alternative is priced in `recommend` for override. The
decision is a transparent policy over measured signals, byte-identical across
the TS and Rust engines (see `reference/parity-ts.mjs`).

## 6. End-to-end: cost per successful task — `npm run paired`   *(the open frontier)*

The honest end number is cost per *successful* task, tool-off (log inlined) vs
tool-on (the log stashed; the agent gets a ~300-token map plus the tanuki tools
and fetches what it needs). We ran it on a 1,200-line log, `claude-sonnet-5`.
It did not go well for the autonomous arm:

| arm | result |
| --- | --- |
| off (log inlined) | passes, but cost swings wildly ($0.02 → $1.81/run as the agent re-reads) |
| on (autonomous tanuki tools) | **fails** — the agent over-fetches/images, never converges, hits the turn cap (450k–760k input tokens/run) |

This is a real finding, not a stub: **the fully-autonomous loop is not a win
yet.** Handed the tools with no discipline, a capable agent still thrashes —
fetching, imaging, re-fetching. What is *proven* is the input-side compression
(§1–5) driven **explicitly**: call `estimate`, read the verdict, render when it
says so. That is the documented default (model in charge, one step at a time),
and it is where the measured savings live. The autonomous "give the agent the
tools and walk away" story needs work on the tool outputs and the loop before
it earns a number here — so it does not get a flattering one.

## Reproduce

```
# pricing (no key, deterministic)
node dist/cli.js estimate <log> 0 --model claude-opus-4

# read-back fidelity: render sealed pages, transcribe, score by containment
node reference/needle-report.mjs                                    # pages + answers.json
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... NEEDLE_MODELS=claude-opus-5,claude-sonnet-5 node reference/needle-call.mjs

# task comprehension (text arm vs image arm), your model + seeds
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... TASK_MODEL=claude-sonnet-5 TASK_SEEDS=11,23,37,41,59 node reference/task-report.mjs

# lossy tiers: token saving (deterministic) + task success per tier
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... TIER_MODEL=claude-sonnet-5 TIER_SEEDS=11,23,37,41,59 node reference/tier-report.mjs

# end-to-end paired runs (the open one); costs real money, caps agent turns
node reference/paired-report.mjs --dry                              # plan only, no calls
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... PAIRED_MODEL=claude-sonnet-5 PAIRED_RUNS=2 node reference/paired-report.mjs
```

The 2026-07-28 run above cost ≈ **$7** of API — most of it the paired agent
loop, which is exactly why that arm is capped and run last. Thinking models
need a raised `max_tokens` (the harnesses set it) or they truncate mid-thought.
Rerun any table with more seeds/models before trusting a single delta; the
point of shipping the harness is that you don't have to trust ours.
