# Evals

tanuki publishes the **harness, not a percentage.** A savings number nobody
can re-measure is the exact failure this project exists to avoid (the rakuen
post *"Token compression tools measure the wrong thing"* — this repo's own
bar). Every harness is seeded and reproducible.

Below is a real API run on **2026-07-28** across five models — `claude-opus-5`,
`claude-opus-4-8`, `claude-sonnet-5`, `claude-sonnet-4-5`, `claude-haiku-4-5`.
Where a number does not flatter the tool, it is here anyway.

## TL;DR — what's proven, what's open

- **Proven, deterministic:** imaging cuts input tokens **72–94%** on real logs;
  `estimate` prices it and the router picks the right route (§1, §5).
- **Proven, measured:** dense random strings never survive pixels —
  **0/14 byte-exact, every one of 5 models** — which is *why* the `verbatim`
  sidecar carries them as text and the credential gate refuses to image secrets
  (§2).
- **Model-dependent:** image *comprehension* needs a capable reader —
  opus-4-8 / opus-5 / sonnet-5 solve the task off pixels as well as off text;
  sonnet-4-5 and haiku-4-5 do not (§3). The fidelity band is calibrated to a
  capable reader — measure yours.
- **Open, not a win yet:** handing the tools to a fully-autonomous agent loop
  thrashes on our harness. Drive tanuki *explicitly* (estimate → render); don't
  dump the tools on the agent and hope (§6).

## The seam: three capabilities, one of them conditional

Every result below splits along the same line. tanuki bundles three separable
capabilities, and they do not carry equal risk.

- **A. Imaging** — characters become pixels. Every bad result in this document
  belongs to A: read-back of dense random strings (§2), the two tested models
  that score 0% on pages (§3), the tiers that break the task (§4), and the
  capped cost case (§6) — prompt caching prices a stable inlined log at
  **$0.30/Mtok**, so plain inlining wins the median **3.5×**. A is conditional
  on the reader, on the content, and on the tier. §2-§4 and §6 are its
  envelope.
- **B. Stash / fetch / verify** — park bytes under a hash, retrieve slices,
  settle exact values. B has not missed a measurement: byte-identity over
  19.7 MB and sidecar coverage on the same corpus (§7), deterministic
  correction of a one-character misread with no model in the loop (§7),
  credential masking on the way out at 2 false positives in 166,985 lines
  (§8). Exact by construction, not statistically.
- **C. Text reduction** — distill, compress, table, codebook, output stays
  text. Priced on every `estimate` call as `recommend.text` (§5), on a
  denominator now measured against a real tokenizer instead of `chars / 4`
  (§9). No fidelity risk, no model dependence, nothing to read off a page.

A is the capability the tool was named for and the only one whose value is
conditional. B and C hold regardless of which model is reading. And every
figure in this document is **input-side**: whatever share of a bill is output
tokens is a ceiling no input-side tool can cross, however well it compresses.

## 1. Pricing — `estimate --model`   *(deterministic, no vision needed)*

`estimate` prices the decision in real dollars via each provider's tile/patch
rule. Two corpora, two providers:

| corpus | raw text tokens | imaged | cut | $ text → image |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 384 KB / 4,001-line log (opus-4) | 95,980 | 20,160 | **−79%** | $1.44 → $0.30 |
| 384 KB, distill+codebook+tiny (opus-4) | 95,980 | 112 | **−100%** | $1.44 → $0.0017 |
| 1,200-line service log (sonnet-5) | 18,525 | 3,920 | **−79%** | $0.0556 → $0.0118 |

```
node dist/cli.js estimate <log> 0 --model claude-opus-4 [--distill --codebook --font tiny]
```

## 2. Read-back fidelity — `npm run needles`   *(measured)*

Blind byte-exact transcription of 14 dense random needles per density (uuid,
semver, hex id, `sha256:`, `path:line:col`, base64, ms timestamp),
containment-scored:

| model | normal (5×8) | tiny (4×6) |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| claude-opus-5 | 0/14 | 0/14 |
| claude-opus-4-8 | 0/14 | 0/14 |
| claude-sonnet-5 | 0/14 | 0/14 |
| claude-sonnet-4-5 | 0/14 | 0/14 |
| claude-haiku-4-5 | 0/14 | 0/14 |

**0/14 across every model.** The misses are **value-drift** — confident
single-character misreads (`3→1`, `4→a`, `5→8`, `a→3`), delivered as fact, not
blanks. That is the silent failure the project is built around, and **why the
`verbatim` sidecar exists**: it ships 10/14 of these needles as text beside the
pages, so exactness never rides on transcription — but that 10/14 is scored on
needle kinds the scanner already knows; **§7 measures what it misses on real
logs, and the answer is 69%.** (An earlier run scored
opus-5 at 1/14 — read-back of random strings is near-chance, so treat the floor
as 0–1/14, not zero-with-certainty.) `claude-fable-5` refuses the task outright
(`stop_reason: refusal`).

Takeaway: dense random strings — hashes, ids, secrets — must never be trusted
to pixels. The credential gate enforces that for secrets; `tanuki_verify` is
the deterministic backstop for anything you *do* read off a page (`exact` /
`corrected` / `ambiguous` / `absent`, no model), so a silent miss becomes a
flagged one.

`score` also splits *glyph-shape* confusions (a bigger font could recover)
from *value-drift* (it cannot). base64 and ms are deliberately **not** matched
by the production `scanNeedles` sidecar — a generic base64 pattern would
false-positive across normal logs — so they ride font fidelity alone.

## 3. Task comprehension — `npm run taskqual`   *(measured)*

The claim that matters: can the model still **do the job** from image pages?
Find the FATAL root-cause component in a 120-line log, TEXT arm vs IMAGE-pages
arm, same model, same corpus, **n=8 seeds**
(`TASK_MODELS=… npm run taskqual`):

| model | n | text | image | reader |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| claude-opus-4-8 | 8 | 88% | 88% | capable |
| claude-opus-5 | 8 | 100% | 100% | capable |
| claude-sonnet-5 | 8 | 100% | 88% | capable |
| claude-sonnet-4-5 | 8 | 100% | **0%** | **cannot read pages** |
| claude-haiku-4-5 | 8 | 100% | **0%** | **cannot read pages** |

**Image comprehension tracks model capability, and the split is binary.** The
three capable readers match their own text score off the pixels — the whole
thesis, measured: *prose and structure survive imaging.* sonnet-4-5 and
haiku-4-5 score **100% on the text arm and 0% on the image arm** of the same
task. Not degraded — zero. They misread the panic line as a nearby word
(`worker`, `LatenciesMs`), confidently, rather than reporting failure.

**This is no longer just a caveat; it is wired into the product.** The
`fidelity` band maps a density ratio to a DeepSeek-OCR read-back curve that
assumes a capable reader — so for these two models the band was not optimistic,
it was *wrong*: tanuki would answer `fidelity: high, route: image` to a caller
whose measured task success is 0%. Passing `model` to `tanuki_estimate` now
floors the band to `unreliable` and routes to text for any measured weak
reader.

That table is safe to pin where a model→context-window table would not be: a
model id names an **immutable snapshot**, so a measurement of one never goes
stale. The list only ever grows, and an unmeasured model is treated as capable
— today's behaviour, so nothing regresses for a reader we have not tested. Run
the harness on yours before trusting pages for comprehension; the knob that
recovers a weak reader is **a larger font / lower density**, not a lossier
tier.

## 4. Lossy tiers: tokens vs task — `npm run tier`   *(measured)*

Levels 2–4, `--distill`, `--codebook`, `--font tiny` are **not** byte-lossless.
Do they keep the *task* solvable? Same root-cause task per tier, on a capable
reader (`claude-sonnet-5`, **n=5 seeds**):

| tier | image-tokens | vs raw text | task solved |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| L0 normal (near-lossless) | 2,240 | −76% | **5/5** |
| L4 caveman (normal font) | 2,240 | −76% | **5/5** |
| distill (errors kept verbatim) | 728 | −92% | 1/5 |
| L0 tiny (4×6) | 1,400 | −85% | 0/5 |
| distill tiny | 560 | −94% | 1/5 |
| distill+codebook tiny | 560 | −94% | 1/5 |
| L4 caveman tiny | 1,400 | −85% | 0/5 |

The fidelity-preserving cut is **normal font**: L0 and even L4 caveman (which
telegraphs prose but keeps the FATAL line verbatim and legible) hold at 5/5
while cutting **76%**. Two knobs break the task on this reader: **tiny font**
(4×6 is past the legibility cliff — 0/5) and **distill** (reshaping the log into
a denser page drops it to 1/5, even though the FATAL line survives verbatim —
the model reads the smaller, restructured page worse). A stronger reader
(opus-class) tolerates distill better; a weaker one, worse. **The sell:** reach
for L0 or caveman at normal font for a −76% cut with the task intact; reserve
tiny font and heavy distill for bulk you only need the gist of.

## 5. The router — `estimate.route` / `recommend`   *(deterministic)*

Since 0.12.0 `estimate` returns a **`route`**: one hybrid pick (image / text /
raw) that weighs real cost **and** the read-back fidelity band **and** the
content — not just token count. It images only when imaging clears the clean
band *and* is the genuine save; it routes to the lossless text side on
credentials, cached content, or past-the-cliff density. On the 1,200-line log:

```
route: { pick: "image", fidelity: "high", savedPct: 81,
         reason: "imaging clears the read-back band and beats the text side on tokens" }
```

The same call also prices a **no-image** route (`recommend.text`): lossless
whitespace plus a distill sibling, so there is a token answer even when imaging
is the wrong call. On that log, `recommend.text.withDistill` is **100 tokens**
(distill-as-text) vs 18,525 raw — the router's answer when you must keep the
bytes as text. Every alternative is priced in `recommend` for override. The
decision is a transparent policy over measured signals, byte-identical across
the TS and Rust engines (see `reference/parity-ts.mjs`).

## 6. End-to-end: cost per successful task — `npm run paired` / `npm run trace`

The honest end number is cost per *successful* task, tool-off (log inlined) vs
tool-on (the log stashed; the agent gets a ~700-token map plus the tanuki tools
and fetches what it needs), on a 1,200-line log with `claude-sonnet-5`.

### The ceiling on all of it: output is 53% of the bill

Read this before any other number in this file. Every saving tanuki can produce
is **input-side**, and on a measured agent run the input side is not most of the
bill:

| arm | fresh in | cache write | cache read | output tok | **output $ share** |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| off (raw text), n=1 | 10 | 127,708 | 415,462 | 45,914 | **53.3%** |

**Output is 53.3% of modeled spend, so no input-side tool — tanuki included —
can ever cut more than 46.7% of this bill.** Output bills at $15.00/Mtok against
$0.30 for a cache read: a 50× ratio that makes 45,914 output tokens outweigh
543,180 input tokens.

Worse for the pitch, the ceiling *tightens as the tool succeeds*: cutting input
mechanically raises output's share of what remains. An arm whose input tanuki has
already shrunk has a higher output share than the raw arm, so the second half of
any saving is harder-won than the first.

This is **n=1** on the off arm — the budget stopped the run — so treat 53.3% as
an order of magnitude, not a constant, and expect it to swing with how verbose
the agent is. It is nonetheless the number that bounds every other table here,
and it went unmeasured for nine releases. `npm run paired` now reports it per
arm, and refuses to print a ceiling at all if `output_tokens` comes back zero —
otherwise the most flattering possible conclusion ("input is 100% of the bill")
would print silently.

### Rejected: reusing imaged pages across requests

If a byte-identical block is imaged in request N, why image it again in request
N+1? The proxy already collapses an in-request repeat into a short pointer, and
`ProxySession.seenBlocks` already tracks hashes across requests — it looked like
two lines of plumbing. It was built in both engines, and it is wrong for two
independent reasons.

**It inverts the goal.** The same block sits at the same position in every later
request of a conversation. Swapping it for a pointer *changes the prefix*, so the
cache entry for everything from that block onward is invalidated and rewritten —
the exact prefix the `cache_control` breakpoint exists to hold stable. Measured
by the test that caught it: expected body ~59 KB of pages, emitted ~283 bytes of
pointer, divergence starting at message 0. Cross-request substitution does not
avoid cache writes, it causes them. In-request dedupe is safe *only* because the
pointer replaces a second occurrence while the first still carries the pages.

**It also loses the sidecar.** The pointer replaces the whole emitted block
group, `verbatim` included. In-request that is harmless — the first occurrence
still carries the sidecar above it. Across requests the sidecar vanishes with
nothing above to recover it, so every exact id the scanner extracted is gone: a
direct regression on §7's coverage, independent of caching.

So `seenBlocks` stays ledger-only, and both engines now carry a comment saying
why, because the idea is attractive enough to recur. The guard is the proxy test
**"session never changes the emitted bytes"**, which now drives three sequential
calls on a warm session and asserts all three bodies equal the session-less
body. Rust had *no* session coverage at all before this — every Rust proxy test
passed `None` — so the same idea could have landed there alone and gone
unnoticed; that test is now mirrored.

**This section previously reported that "the fully-autonomous loop is not a win
— handed the tools, a capable agent thrashes: fetching, imaging, re-fetching."
That diagnosis was wrong.** It was inferred from token counts. Tracing the loop
call-by-call (`npm run trace`) showed two ordinary bugs, neither of them about
agent discipline:

1. **`tanuki_fetch` was not in the advertised tool surface.** `tanuki_stash`
   was, and fetch is the only way to read a stash back — so the model parked
   text it could never retrieve. The trace is unambiguous: five `ToolSearch`
   calls, then *"No `tanuki_fetch` tool exists in my toolset — I searched
   exhaustively."* Every "over-fetch" token was a tool hunt.
2. **The verbatim sidecar shipped *after* the image blocks.** With fetch
   exposed, the answer was handed to the agent in the sidecar on turn 4 —
   `L21 42440ce06042` — and it re-queried six more times before finding it.
   Exact strings trailing a 12 KB PNG are easy to skip past.

Both are fixed in 0.15: fetch joins the default surface, and every emitter
(`render`, `fetch`, proxy) puts the sidecar **before** the pages.

**The tradeoff that caused bug 1, priced.** The slim surface exists to save
advertised-schema tokens — a real cost, and one worth measuring rather than
assuming. Dead-schema accounting ("tool schemas you pay for on every call but
never invoke") is a first-class check in
[ctxdiff](https://github.com/salmanzafar949/ctxdiff); measured on our own
`tools/list`:

| surface | tools | tokens/request |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| default (brief descriptions) | 5 | **549** |
| `TANUKI_ALL_TOOLS=1` | 8 | 749 |
| `TANUKI_TOOL_VERBOSE=1` | 5 | 1,250 |

Hiding three tools saves **200 tokens per request**; `tanuki_fetch` itself
costs **74**. Hiding it burned **521,000 input tokens in a single failed run**
— a break-even of roughly 7,000 requests, against a workflow it made
impossible. Schema thrift is worth measuring *and* worth losing to a
capability the documented workflow depends on.


A third gap survived those two. `dominant-error-unit` ("which unit logged the
most ERROR lines") still failed, and tracing showed why: **the agent had no way
to count.** A query fetch returns a distilled, context-padded slice, so its
line count is not a match count — and nothing else reported one. Slices cannot
count what they do not show. 0.16 makes a query fetch report the raw tally:

```
[query matched 18 of 1201 lines]
```

which turns "which unit dominates" into six cheap queries. Measured:

| task | arm | before | after |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| `upstream-502-request-id` (read an id verbatim) | on | **0/1 FAIL**, 521k in-tokens | **PASS** |
| `dominant-error-unit` (count the whole log) | on | **FAIL** | **PASS** |

Both arms now solve both tasks. **The cost comparison is where this gets
interesting, and where an earlier version of this section was wrong twice.**

At n=1 the tool arm looked ~6× cheaper ($0.17 vs $1.03) and this section
called it "the first measured case where the loop beats inlining." At n=3 with
a warm cache the same comparison came out at parity ($0.171 vs $0.148). Both
were artifacts. Here is n=9 per arm, `claude-sonnet-5`, both tasks pooled:

| | inlining (off) | tanuki (on) |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| success | 9/9 | 9/9 |
| **median cost/run** | **$0.049** | $0.173 |
| mean cost/run | $0.392 | $0.175 |
| worst run | **$2.94** | **$0.225** |
| spread (max/min) | 10–73× | **1–2×** |

**Inlining is usually cheaper, and occasionally catastrophic.** By median it
beats tanuki 3.5×: prompt caching makes re-reading an inlined log nearly free,
which is exactly the cached-content case §5's router already sends to text. But
its cost distribution has a long right tail — one `dominant-error-unit` run hit
**$2.94**, a 73× spread within a single task — because nothing bounds how often
the agent re-reads.

The tool arm's distribution is flat: **$0.124–$0.225 across nine runs**, a 2×
spread, because it ships a ~700-token map and a 40-token count instead of the
log. So the honest claim is not "cheaper" — it is **predictable**, with a worst
case 13× better ($0.225 vs $2.94). Whether that trade is worth it depends on
whether you are optimising the median bill or the tail.

A mean-only reading would have said "tanuki is 2.24× cheaper" ($0.392 vs
$0.175) and been just as misleading in the other direction — the mean is one
$2.94 run.

### What that median gap is actually made of

Prompt caching is doing the work on both sides, and the harness could not see
it: `paired-report` summed `input_tokens`, `cache_read_input_tokens` and
`cache_creation_input_tokens` into one figure. Those three are priced **$3.00 /
$0.30 / $3.75 per Mtok** on Sonnet — a 12.5× spread between the cheapest and
dearest — so one collapsed number cannot distinguish a cheap run from a cached
one, and every "why" in this section was unfalsifiable. 0.18 records them
separately and reports a cache hit rate.

With the split in place, the tail stops being mysterious
(`claude-sonnet-5`, both tasks, budget-capped mid-run):

| arm | fresh | cache **write** | cache **read** | hit rate | $/success |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| off (inlining) | 14 | **215,673** | 529,067 | **71%** | $0.9952 |
| on (tanuki) | 24 | **42,237** | 498,953 | **92%** | $0.1955 |

Both arms read a similar volume from cache. The difference is entirely in
**cache writes — the inlining arm creates 5.1× more of them**, at 12.5× the
price of a read. That is the $2.94 outlier's mechanism, and it is not "the
agent re-read the log" as this section previously guessed: a re-read of a
*warm* prefix is nearly free. It is that inlining a large body keeps
invalidating the prefix and paying to re-create it, while tanuki's payload is
small and byte-stable, so it stays cached (92%).

That also explains why the median and the mean disagreed so violently: the
median run is one where the off arm's cache happened to hold, the tail is one
where it churned. Compare arms at equal hit rate or the token columns are
meaningless — which is exactly what summing the three classes hid.

### Corollary: shrinking a cached payload buys almost nothing

The `verbatim` sidecar is **42% of a render's tokens** (5,611 of 13,213 on a
1,200-line service log), so `verbatim: "lazy"` — ship a one-line pointer, defer
the strings to `tanuki_fetch`/`tanuki_verify` — looked like the largest single
payload cut available. Measured as its own arm (`PAIRED_ARMS=on,lazy`,
`claude-sonnet-5`, budget-capped):

| arm | cache write | hit rate | $/success | solved |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| on (full sidecar) | 126,687 | 94% | $0.3351 | 4/6 |
| lazy | 57,269 | **97%** | $0.3168 | 3/5 |

Lazy halves the cache writes and improves the hit rate, and the cost
difference is **inside the noise at this n**. The reason is the previous
table: once a payload is cached it is billed at **$0.30/Mtok**, so removing
42% of a *cached* payload removes 42% of the cheapest thing in the request.

**So lazy stays opt-in, not the default.** The measurement says the lever
worth pulling is keeping the cache warm, not making the payload smaller —
which inverts the intuition the sidecar-size number invites. Both arms also
failed runs on the verbatim task (the `on` arm 2 of 6), so this is not
evidence that lazy hurts recall either; it is evidence that at n=5-6 this task
is too flaky to separate them. Lazy remains the right choice for cold,
one-shot renders where nothing is cached yet.

That reframes the goal. Losing the median to inlining is not a compression
problem; it is that a re-read of an already-cached log costs almost nothing
while tanuki paid full price for its pages **every turn**. Imaged pages are the
ideal thing to cache — large, re-sent verbatim each turn, and byte-stable
(asserted in the render tests since 0.16.1) — but the proxy priced caching
without ever creating it. 0.18 places one `cache_control` breakpoint on the last
imaged message:

| turns re-sending a 7,530-token page set | uncached | cached | |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 3 | $0.0678 | $0.0328 | 2.1× |
| 5 | $0.1129 | $0.0373 | 3.0× |
| 10 | $0.2259 | $0.0486 | **4.7×** |

This is arithmetic at published rates, not an end-to-end measurement — the
paired run that would confirm it needs a working key and is **not yet done**.
The breakpoint counts the client's existing ones first and declines at
Anthropic's ceiling of four, so it cannot break a request that already worked.

The lesson worth keeping: **a token count is a symptom, not a diagnosis.** Two
releases of narrative about agent behaviour dissolved the moment the loop was
actually traced, and all three causes turned out to be ordinary missing
capabilities: a tool that was not advertised, a text block in the wrong order,
and no way to count.

## 7. Sidecar coverage on real logs — `npm run coverage` / `npm run adversarial`

The needle harness (§2) seeds uuid/semver/hex/digest/path — **the same kinds
the scanner's allowlist already matches.** So its 20/20 measured *that the two
lists agree*, not how much of a real log is protected. The miss that actually
hurt was a high-entropy string nobody wrote a regex for, riding as pixels
silently. Credit for the framing goes to a reader who spotted it; here is the
check they proposed, run on **19.7 MB of real logs** (systemd journal, kernel,
git history, pacman), plus the fix it forced.

A token counts as **at-risk** when a single-character misread would be both
*silent* and *unrecoverable*: rare (≤2 occurrences, so repetition can't
self-correct), ≥6 chars, and **not** a format recoverable from context
(durations, ISO timestamps, versions, small ints, words are all excluded).

### What the allowlist actually covered

| | before (0.12) | after (0.14) |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| at-risk ids protected | **1,588 / 5,136 (30.9%)** | **4,568 / 4,568 (100%)** |
| unprotected at-risk chars | 4,204/million = **1 in 238** | **0** |
| needle-dense pages (refused, kept as text) | (silently truncated) | 2 / 1,374 |

Two corrections to the *measurement* were needed to state that honestly, and
both had been understating the engine: the criterion scored paths
(`dev/input/event5`) and UTC timestamps as unrecoverable ids, because `/` is in
the base64 alphabet and the ISO pattern's character class omitted `Z`; and a
**refused** block counted as a miss when a refused block stays text and is
therefore fully readable. The at-risk population changed (5,136 → 4,568) for
the first reason.

The families the allowlist could not name, ranked by misses before the fix —
the reader's three guesses (internal id, pod name, base64 chunk) were the top
three:

| missed | family |
| ---: | --- |
| 1,785 | mixed alnum id (pod name, build id, container id) |
| 617 | MAC address |
| 158 | base64 blob |
| 82 | PCI/USB id |
| 74 | hex run ≥6 (**git short sha** — the allowlist floor was 12) |

### The fix: ask the answerable question

"Is this a known id format?" has an unbounded complement — every id format
anyone will ever invent. "Is this token *recoverable* if one character flips?"
has a small, enumerable one. 0.13 inverts the classifier: ship a token unless
it is provably recoverable, using structure rather than a format list —
a long alnum run mixing letters and digits, or a long alphabetic run that is
not a word (words alternate vowels and consonants; random letters pile up).
Bias is to recall: a false positive costs a few tokens and is never wrong.

A second, independent hole compounded the first: `NEEDLE_CAP` was a flat 32
per rendered block, so **74% of 240-line pages hit it and dropped 31% of the
needles the scanner had already found** (10% at 120 lines). Better patterns
are worthless while the cap discards them.

**0.13.0 half-fixed this and shipped a worse bug.** Scaling the cap by line
count (32…512) stopped the truncation but left the cap *bounding its own
cost*: a needle-dense block therefore stayed cheap while dropping the ids the
sidecar exists to carry, and the router picked it up as a bargain —

```
720 at-risk ids | sidecar kept 120 | dropped 600 | dense=true
route: {"pick":"image", "fidelity":"high", "savedPct":65}
```

600 values unverifiable, imaged at "high" fidelity. The cost math structurally
cannot catch this, because the thing that overflowed is the thing that would
have priced it. 0.13.1 fixes both halves:

- the cap is a **budget, not a count** — the sidecar grows until its text
  would reach half the **raw** characters it protects, the point where imaging
  stops paying. Measured against raw, not the compressed text handed to the
  scanner, or a `codebook`/`tiny` run would be refused precisely for
  compressing well.
- `dense` is a **hard refusal**, ranked with credentials: `route` stays text,
  `verdict` reads `TEXT cheaper (needle-dense)`.

Real-log pages flagged dense fell **21/1393 → 2/1393** (fewer false
truncations) while the genuinely id-dense block is now correctly refused.
Cost of all this: **~10 extra text tokens per 120-line page**, about 0.5% of
that page's image cost.

### The check that cannot be a tautology — `npm run adversarial`

Coverage scored against a hand-written risk criterion still compares two lists
from the same head. So the engine is also tested against **synthetic ids in
shapes it was never designed around**, injected into real log lines:

| | 0.12 | 0.14 |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| mean catch rate, **26 shapes × 500 draws** | **62.8%** | **94.4%** |
| pure-alphabetic random (`ryvkuvrdmg`) | **0/500** | 349/500 |
| KSUID, snowflake, ARN, JWT, dash-less UUID, IPv6, docker id, traceparent | — | **100%** |
| S3 version id, URL-safe base64, pod-style, ulid, slash-path | — | 93–100% |

This is what found the worst bug: a blanket `^[A-Za-z]+$` "words are
recoverable" rule was waving through **every** random alphabetic id, 0/500.
**Every named real-world format now scores 93–100%.**

**Residual, stated plainly:** pure-random alphabets still escape — 70–76% on
the three weakest shapes. Structure alone cannot separate `UXASIMOWMOFRUAB`
(47% vowels, longest consonant run 2) from a word without a dictionary.

Three shape-free oracles were tried and **rejected rather than shipped**.
Shannon entropy over a token's own characters measures diversity, not
unpredictability (it flags `ocean-sound-theme` and `DESIGN.md`). Bigram
surprisal against the corpus scores MACs *low*, because `NN:NN` pairs are
everywhere. And in-block frequency — "a long alphabetic token appearing once
is likelier an id than vocabulary" — was measured on the real corpus rather
than argued about:

| corpus | needles now | frequency rule would ADD |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| journal | 39,571 | +19,135 (19/page, worst 95) |
| gitlog | 2,010 | +8,039 (32/page) |
| pacman | 7,703 | +2,776 (25/page) |

The additions are `DISCONNECTED`, `generated`, `configuration`, `firmware`,
`information` — plain vocabulary. At 19–32 false needles per page the sidecar
bloats and pages tip to `dense`, which since 0.13.1 means **imaging is refused
outright**. The rule costs the compression win to chase a shape with *zero
instances across 19.5 MB of real logs*. Declined, with numbers.

**The residual is not unprotected data, and that is testable.** A random
alphabetic id that rides as pixels is still covered by `tanuki_verify` against
the stash — measured on exactly the ids the sidecar misses:

| id | in sidecar | verify(exact) | verify(one char flipped) |
| --- | :---: | --- | --- |
| `ryvkuvrdmg` | yes | `exact` | `corrected` |
| `UXASIMOWMOFRUAB` | **no** | `exact` | `corrected` |
| `oazhseiengfosy` | **no** | `exact` | `corrected` |
| `qsYfhjBOhAqAOqRRr` | **no** | `exact` | `corrected` |

So the bound is: the sidecar carries 100% of at-risk ids on real logs and
~94% of synthetic shapes; anything it misses is still recoverable from the
stash and checkable without a model. That is the honest ceiling, not a promise
that every conceivable string rides as text.

### What is actually exact — the lossless spine

Pixel accuracy is not, and will never be, 1-in-10-million; §2 measures 0/14
across five models. The **stash** is a different guarantee, exact by
construction rather than statistically: original bytes held under a sha256,
`tanuki_verify` checking any string against them with no model in the loop.
Measured end to end on the same corpus — stash, fetch `redact:false`, compare
(the store is raw bytes either way; the default fetch masks credential-shaped
values on the way into the context window, so byte-identity is asserted with
the mask off):

```
dmesg.log        218,036 bytes  BYTE-IDENTICAL
pacman.log     1,036,967 bytes  BYTE-IDENTICAL
gitlog.log     1,469,888 bytes  BYTE-IDENTICAL
journal.log   16,998,002 bytes  BYTE-IDENTICAL
== recovered byte-exact: 19,722,893 / 19,722,893 characters
```

**Zero characters dropped in 19.7 million**, and it is not a sampling result —
the bytes are addressed by hash. So for do-or-die logs the answer is not "trust
the pixels": treat the image as a navigation index over bytes that stay
recoverable in full, keep exact strings in the sidecar, and settle anything you
read off a page with `tanuki_verify`.

## 8. Credential redaction: measured false-positive rate   *(measured)*

The credential gate has always refused to *image* a secret. It never stopped
`tanuki_fetch` from returning one as text — the same secret in the same context
window by a shorter route. 0.18 masks them on the way out.

Building it exposed that the detector had the **same flaw the sidecar
classifier had in 0.12**: nine rules, each matching a value by its own *shape*.
That works only for vendors who prefix their tokens (`AKIA…`, `ghp_…`,
`sk-ant-…`). An AWS **secret** access key is 40 characters of base64 with no
marker at all — indistinguishable from a build hash by shape — so
`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=wJalr…` walked straight through a feature whose whole
job was to stop it. An allowlist of known shapes has an unbounded complement.

The fix is the inversion that worked before: stop asking what the value looks
like and ask what the **key** calls it. When the left side of an assignment
names a secret, the right side is one regardless of shape.

Name-based rules invite false positives, so the bounds were tuned against the
same 19.7 MB real-log corpus used for sidecar coverage (journal, dmesg, git
log, pacman — 166,985 lines). Each bound below is there because it was
*measured*, not guessed:

| rule | why | false positives removed |
| --- | --- | ---: |
| secret word must **end** the key | `systemd-ask-password-console.path: Deactivated` is a status line | 8 |
| **singular only** (no `tokens`) | `imageTokens: rev.tokens` is source code | 84 |
| value excludes **backticks** | `` const token = `frame-…` `` is a template literal | 2 |
| value must not start with `[` | otherwise it re-redacts `[redacted:aws-key]` and double-counts | — |

Residual: **2 hits in 166,985 lines (1 in 83,493)** — and both are real
secrets, not noise: a test fixture holding an `sk-ant-` key, and
`"x-api-key": process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. Against a set of assignment-shaped
secrets the shape rules all miss (`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=`, `db_password:`,
`{"client_secret": …}`, `DATABASE_PASSWORD=`) it is 4/4.

Two boundaries stated rather than hidden:

- **The mask is on `fetch`, not on the stash.** The store keeps raw bytes —
  that is what makes the 19,722,893-character byte-identity round-trip
  assertable at all — and `redact: false` returns them. The threat model is
  bytes entering a context window, not bytes on your own disk.
- **`private-key` still matches only the `BEGIN` header**, so a PEM *body*
  ships as text under a redacted header. Widening it needs the same edit in
  both engines; a second heuristic was deliberately not added, because then the
  gate and the mask could disagree about what a secret is.

A parity case pins `password=password`, where an `indexOf`-based splice masks
the key instead of the value and silently diverges between engines.

## 9. The token estimator — `npm run tokenizer`   *(measured)*

`textTokens` in `src/serde.ts` is the denominator of every decision the router
makes: the imaging gate (`cost > rawTok * ratio`), the minimum saving, the
fidelity band's ratio, and the entire saved-token ledger. It was `chars / 4`
and had never been checked against a real tokenizer.

**The error does not cancel.** Image tokens come from pixel geometry
(`w*h/750`, exact); text tokens came from a guess. Measured against
Anthropic's own tokenizer (`/v1/messages/count_tokens`, free — this whole
section cost $0), 30 samples:

| content | real chars/token | `chars/4` was |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| prose | 4.97 | **+24% high** |
| gitlog | 2.90 | −27% low |
| stack-trace | 2.77 | −31% low |
| ts-source | 3.00 | −25% low |
| journal | 2.42 | −39% low |
| dmesg | 2.21 | −45% low |
| json | 1.92 | −52% low |
| pacman | 1.90 | −53% low |
| hex | 1.55 | −61% low |
| base64 | 1.14 | **−72% low** |

A **2.8× spread**, and it straddles zero: prose was over-priced, logs
under-priced. So tanuki declined log wins it should have taken *and* imaged
prose it should have left alone. One divisor cannot fit that, so `textTokens`
now prices character classes by how a BPE treats them — letters in a word-like
run are nearly free (~6 chars/token), letters in a vowelless or overlong run
(base64, hex, ids) fragment to well under one, digits and punctuation
fragment, whitespace mostly merges into the next word. Least squares over the
30 samples, integer per-mille weights so both engines are bit-identical.

### Held out, not fitted — the honest bound

"Worst residual 19.8%" was the *fit* on those 30 samples, which is the number a
model always flatters itself with. A second, larger and deliberately more
diverse batch of **37 measurements** (real logs, TS and Rust source, markdown,
CSV, JSON, stack traces, UUIDs, paths, mixed ids, plus synthetic extremes) was
then scored against the **shipped** weights without refitting:

| | `chars/4` | shipped estimator |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| real content, n=30 — worst | 65.6% | **16.2%** |
| real content — median | 38.3% | **3.3%** |
| real logs only, n=18 — worst | — | **11.6%** |
| real logs — median | — | **2.7%** |
| synthetic extremes, n=7 — worst | 71.3% | **239%** |

On the content tanuki actually routes it holds up: **median 3.3%, worst 16.2%**,
against 38.3% / 65.6% for the old divisor. On real source code specifically
(TypeScript and Rust files from this repo) it lands between −3.2% and +14.2%.

**The 239% is real and worth naming.** It is a synthetic blob of nothing but
long camelCase identifiers (`someLongCamelCaseIdentifierNumber123 = …`). Runs
over 14 characters are priced as random blobs at ~1.5 tokens/char, but a BPE
splits camelCase into known subwords, so the estimate is 3.4× too high. Real
source code never triggers it — punctuation, keywords and digits break the runs
up — but generated or machine-mangled identifier soup could.

**The obvious fix was measured and rejected.** Splitting alpha runs at
lowercase→uppercase boundaries before the word test collapses that case from
239% to −27%, and also fixes base64 (−33% → −1.6%) and solid hex (+38% → +1.8%).
But on the 30 real samples it is *worse*: median 5.7% against 3.3%. Trading a
2.4-point median regression on everything real to fix a fixture nobody will send
is the wrong trade, so the shipped weights stand and the bound is documented
instead. All weights are non-negative by construction; a negative one would
claim a character class makes text cheaper.

`test/tokens.test.ts` pins the measured counts, keeps the held-out families as
fixtures, and includes a guard asserting `chars/4` would still fail the suite —
a bound that stops discriminating is a decorative bound.

### It also re-calibrated the fidelity band

The band's 8/12/16/20 thresholds come from DeepSeek-OCR's Fox table, which
defines its ratio with a **real tokenizer**. Feeding it `chars/4` made every
ratio ~1.5× too low on logs, i.e. tanuki reported a rosier read-back band than
the density warranted. Re-running the tier sweep after the fix
(`claude-sonnet-5`, n=5):

| tier | ratio now | band says | task solved |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| L0 normal | 8.3 | good, ~90-97% | **5/5** |
| L0 tiny | 14.3 | low (tiny floor) | **0/5** |
| distill | 25 | unreliable, <60% | **1/5** |
| distill tiny | 33 | unreliable | 1/5 |
| L4 caveman | 8.3 | good | 5/5 |

Band and outcome now agree: *good* ↔ 100%, *unreliable* ↔ 20%. Under `chars/4`
distill scored a ratio near 16 and was labelled **"degraded, ~75-87%"** while
actually solving **1 task in 5**. The estimator fix removed a miscalibration
nobody had looked for.

Two offline attempts at ground truth were tried first and discarded, which is
why this waited for a key: assistant `output_tokens` from local session logs
(thinking bills to output but is not in the logged text — 161 chars against
962 tokens), and input-token deltas across turns (Claude Code elides tool
results, so the reconstruction spans 0.15–20.15 chars/token, i.e. noise).

## 10. Retrieval precision — `npm run retrieval`   *(measured, no model)*

§6 measures whether the agent *answered*, which conflates two failures needing
opposite fixes: tanuki handed back a slice without the answer, or tanuki handed
back the answer and the model fumbled it. The last run solved 4 of 6 and we
could not say which. This harness separates them, deterministically, with **no
API key and no model** — it asks only whether the ground truth came back as
**readable text**.

Three outcomes per (answer, query-strategy) pair, and the distinction is the
whole point:

- **TEXT** — the value is in a text block. Recoverable.
- **PIXELS** — it is in the slice but only on a page. Since read-back of exact
  strings is measured at **0/14** (§2), this is scored a MISS, not a success.
- **ABSENT** — not retrievable by that strategy at all.

Measured on `opsCorpus()`, four strategies × three planted answers, **identical
cell-for-cell on both engines**:

| answer | exact-substring | near-keyword | alt-keyword | line-range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| request id `42440ce06042` | TEXT | TEXT | TEXT | TEXT |
| version `9.4.1-rc.2` | TEXT | TEXT | TEXT | TEXT |
| unit `ingest` | **PIXELS** | **PIXELS** | **PIXELS** | **PIXELS** |

**Retrieval precision 8/12 = 66.7%**, and the 4 misses are one coherent cause:
the `verbatim` sidecar carries id-, hash-, version- and path-shaped strings.
**`ingest` is a bare English word**, so no strategy ever carries it as text —
every route puts it on a page only.

That resolves the §6 ambiguity precisely: **a failure on
`dominant-error-unit` is retrieval; a failure on the id or version tasks is
reasoning.** Two different bugs that had been averaging into one number.

The aggregate answer is still settleable from text, by a different route — the
`[query matched N of M lines]` marker added in 0.16. Per-unit ERROR counts come
back `ingest=16, api-gateway=5, worker=5, cache=5, scheduler=4, relay=4`, so the
marker ranks the answer first by 3.2×, and the harness asserts that ranking. If
the marker ever stops reporting raw counts, the question becomes unanswerable
from text at all.

### The control I specified was invalid, and the harness said so

The brief asked for a no-match query as the zero baseline. Measured, it scores
**2 of 3 TEXT, not 0**: distill keeps every ERROR/WARN line regardless of query,
and all three answers are planted on ERROR/WARN lines, so even a random hex
query hands both ids back. Using it as the zero baseline would have "proved" the
instrument worked while measuring nothing. It is kept and printed as a finding;
the valid zero control is a **near-miss decoy** set (`egress`, `9.4.1-rc.3`,
`42440ce06043`), which scores 0/12 and proves the classifier matches returned
bytes exactly rather than approximately.

Non-vacuity is proven by mutation, not asserted: making the classifier count any
reply containing images as TEXT — the whole-dump-grep regression — inflates
precision to 12/12 and trips two controls. Disabling the sidecar
(`TANUKI_VERBATIM=off`) drops precision to 0.0% while all four controls still
pass, which is the correct split: controls check the instrument, the gate checks
the engine.

```

The 2026-07-28 run above cost ≈ **$7** of API — most of it the paired agent
loop, which is exactly why that arm is capped and run last. Thinking models
need a raised `max_tokens` (the harnesses set it) or they truncate mid-thought.
Rerun any table with more seeds/models before trusting a single delta; the
point of shipping the harness is that you don't have to trust ours.
